# Post Reader

Post Reader is a Github project/repository that can be forked to deploy and host a website that aggregates user submitted hyperlinks ("posts"), for your specific topic, to Github Pages. Anyone with a GitHub account that creates a Pull Request can contribute content to the website.

It also includes an integration into an AI-driven content summariser for those instances where contributors omit certain meta content or summaries. 

The source repository (this one), includes a few example posts related to [Angular](https://angular.dev/), the framework this repository was built with. These examples can be viewed at this repository's [Github Page](https://thebeard.github.io/post-reader/).

## How to submit your Post

## How to use this Github Repository to create your own Hyperlink Post site

### Select your hosting and deployment method

#### Github Pages

By default, for any commits made to the `main` branch of your new repository, a deployment to Github Pages will triggered using Github Workflows.

Configure your Custom Domain to allow your website to display on your pre-registered domain of choice.

To disable Github Pages deployments, delete the file `.github/workflows/npm-publish-github-packages.yml`

#### Via Terraform

A sample set of terraform scripts can be found at the `/terraform` location. The sample terraform scripts are configured to deploy to AWS. Update and use as per your cloud provider and CI/CD framework accordingly.

See **Other** section below as well.

#### Other

When setting up your own build and continuous integration pipelines, please note this application uses a custom npm command. Use `npm run build-with-content` to build your application.


### Fork the application

1. Go to [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com) and create an account
1. Go to the [TLDRThis](https://rapidapi.com/tldrthishq-tldrthishq-default/api/tldrthis) API and subscribe to it
1. Copy your X-RapidAPI-key
1. Copy the URL found in the **Code snippets** section (with the trailing slash)
1. Fork the project to a new public repository
1. Go to the forked repo's Settings page
1. Go to **Secrets and Variables** >> **Actions**
1. To the repository secrets add the `SUMMARISEAPI` secret
1. Also add the `SUMMARISEAPIKEY` you copied at step (3)
1. Go to **Actions** >> **General** and enable Github Actions
1. Go to **Pages** and for the **Build and deployment** >> **Source** setting, select **Github Actions**
1. Ensure necessary Pull Request and Commit permissions are set up to allow for post approvals by the administrator and/or moderators
1. Change the title at the top of this markdown file (`# Post Reader`)
1. Change the two intro paragraphs at the top of this markdown file, to reflect the topic and purpose of your own website.
1. In the file located at `src/app/app.config.ts` change the site title on **line 24**
1. Remove the example posts in the `src/content` folder
1. See **Base Path Management** below
1. Submit and commit your first post

### Base Path Management

Due to this repository defaulting to Github Pages, there is a deployment step in the NPM tasks in the [package.json]('./package.json) file to include a base path in the build step. Depending on your hosting selection you will have to make one of the following changes

#### Github Pages (without custom domain)

Go to the [package.json](./package.json) file, line 13, and replace `/post-reader/` with the base path associated with your Github Pages page

#### Github Pages (with custom domain) and others

Depending on your hosting/website configuration, go to the [package.json](./package.json) file and update line 13 as required. Likely you have to remove the `--base-href` argument
